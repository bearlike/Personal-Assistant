#@doc
# * This GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry.
# * It is triggered when a branch is created with the name syntax "release/[version]-[channel]".
#
# The workflow does the following:
# 1. Checks out the code, sets up Docker buildx, Login to the registry.
# 2. Extracts the branch name from the GITHUB_REF environment variable.
# 3. Splits the branch name to get the version and channel.
# 4. Builds and pushes the Docker image.

# Examples:
# If the branch name is 'release/1.0.0-latest', the image is tagged as '1.0.0' and 'latest'.
# If the branch name is 'release/1.0.1-stable', the image is tagged as '1.0.1' and 'stable'.
# If the branch name is 'release/1.0.2-dev', the image is tagged as '1.0.2-dev'.
#
# * The 'latest' and 'stable' tags allow us to easily switch between different versions.
# *  The 'dev' tag allows you to have a separate version for development.
