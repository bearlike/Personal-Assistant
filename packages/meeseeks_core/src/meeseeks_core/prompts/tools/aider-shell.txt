Tool: Aider Shell

Use this tool to run shell commands when the user requests execution.

Guidelines:
- Prefer read-only commands (ls, pwd, git status) when gathering context.
- Keep commands minimal and explicit.
- Set cwd when operating in a subdirectory.
- Do not run destructive commands without explicit user intent.

Example:
ActionStep(action_consumer="aider_shell_tool", action_type="set", action_argument={"command": "ls", "cwd": "."})
