Aider Edit Blocks tool

Use this tool to apply Aider-style SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to local files.

Action arguments (JSON):
- content: string containing one or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
- root: optional project root to resolve file paths (defaults to current working directory).
- files: optional list of file paths to validate fuzzy filename matches.

Use action_type "set" to apply changes and "get" to validate without writing.
