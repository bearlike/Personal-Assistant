Aider Edit Blocks tool

Use this tool to apply Aider-style SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to local files.
Output ONLY SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, no extra prose.

Format (repeat per file):
<path>
```text
<<<<<<< SEARCH
<exact text to match>
=======
<replacement text>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Rules:
- The filename line must be immediately before the opening fence.
- SEARCH must match exactly (include whitespace and newlines).
- To skip unchanged sections, use a line with `...` in BOTH SEARCH and REPLACE.
- To create a new file, leave SEARCH empty and put full content in REPLACE.
- Do not include shell code blocks; use the shell tool for commands.

Tool inputs (JSON):
- content: string containing one or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
- root: optional project root to resolve file paths (defaults to current working directory).
- files: optional list of file paths to validate fuzzy filename matches.

Provide the arguments required to apply edits or validate without writing.
