# Personal Assistant Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Meeseeks: The Personal Assistant**. This site is built with MkDocs + Material and versioned with Mike so you can browse docs for both development and released versions.

## What is Meeseeks?

Meeseeks is a multi-agent assistant that breaks complex user requests into smaller actions, runs them through tools, and provides a consolidated response. This documentation covers how to run the project locally and how to explore the core APIs.

## Docs Sections

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for local setup and development tips.
- [Reference](reference.md) for API documentation generated from the source code.
